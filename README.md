## First Streamlit App Using Python, S3, Rivery, Snowflaek, and Web Services Rest APIs

# Snowflake's Revolution

Snowflake’s impact on the industry is truly remarkable, and it is a testament to the value of innovation and forward thinking. 
By challenging traditional methods of data management and storage, Snowflake has demonstrated that there's always room for improvement and growth in any industry. 
I have just completed the second badge in Snowflake’s Hands on Essentials Series: The Data Applications badge. 

# Streamlit App
I had the opportunity to build a Python Streamlit application using Github, Streamlit, Python, Rivery, Snowflake, and Web Services Rest APIs. The application ingests real time data into Snowflake for analytics. 

# Learning Outcomes 

Through this workshop, I learned more about External Stages (S3 buckets), file formats, semi-structured data loading and querying, and COPY INTO statements. 
Moreover, I learned about Internal Stages and came to understand how they differ from External Stages. 
I learned about SnowSQL (Snowflake’s CLI tool) to perform file PUTs. I learned how to connect my snowflake account to Snowflake’s Data Integration Partner, Rivery – for data ingestion. I also learned about user defined functions and variables in Snowflake, and how they are used to ingest data in real time.

# Final Word
Before this course and the Data Management class offered by professor Franck, I only knew how to manipulate, visualize, and model data from spreadsheets. I had very little experience when it came to the really difficult work of data architecture and data pipelines. Now, I understand where data is coming from and how Snowflake can be used to connect with external stages like AWS or Tableau to put all the pieces together.
